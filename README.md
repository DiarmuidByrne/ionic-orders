# Ionic Orders
## Branch Usage
- Master - Do NOT directly commit to. The branch effectively representing the product in its current state.
- Develop - Development branch for testing and finalization of features. Avoid committing to if possible.
- [Feature branch] - Develop features on a separate branch, e.g. a potato peeling feature; name it potato-peeler. Merge to develop once done.
